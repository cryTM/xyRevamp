        <p>This webapp is still in development. There will be bugs, but hopefully they won't affect gameplay very much.

          If this is your first time playing, you may wish to read <a href=https://pxy-2.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/index.jsp>the changelog and list of known issues</a>.
          
          Your computer's IP address will always be logged when you load the game client. It is not tied in any way to your username, except possibly if a server error occurs. Gameplay results are logged permanently, but without information identifying you.
